# Data Structures Basics Colab by Atharva S Chitre

Welcome to the Data Structures Basics Colab created by Atharva S Chitre. This collaborative Jupyter notebook is designed to provide a hands-on introduction to the fundamentals of data structures and their basic operations using Python.

## About the Author

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Atharva, a student at AIML-LDCE Ahmedabad with a passion for unraveling challenges and creating solutions. As an aspiring Game Developer, I find joy in the intricacies of problem-solving and thrive in the world of code.

## Purpose of this Colab

The primary objective of this Colab is to familiarize users with basic operations associated with fundamental data structures. Whether you're a beginner building a solid understanding of data structures or a seasoned developer revisiting the basics, this Colab offers practical insights into common operations.

## Content Overview

Explore the following fundamental data structures and their basic operations:

- **Arrays and Linked Lists:** Learn the basics and perform operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Stacks and Queues:** Understand the principles behind stacks and queues, and execute common operations.
- **Trees and Graphs:** Get an introduction to tree and graph structures, focusing on basic operations.
- **Hashing Techniques:** Learn about basic hashing concepts and operations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in your preferred environment (e.g., Google Colab).
3. Run the code cells sequentially to observe the implementation of basic operations on different data structures.
4. Feel free to experiment, modify the code, and collaborate with others to strengthen your understanding of data structures.
